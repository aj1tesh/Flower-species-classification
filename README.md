# Iris Species Prediction App

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the species of an iris flower using user-inputted features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). The app allows users to choose between different machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and provides visual insights into data distribution and feature importance. Additionally, it displays model accuracy and collects user feedback on predictions, making it a flexible and interactive tool for iris species classification.
